Prototype
Confuses it with __proto__
Shares screen without requesting/asking
Took long time to reach to application of prototypes: Polyfils and new functionalities
Coding - long silence before starting the question, could have discussed/confirmed input/output format if unfamiliar 


Async/defer
window.onload vs document.ready
Defer vs last of body tag - right attempt but needs refinement


How a webpage renders
Starts with Painting phase - which is wrong. Should have begun with tokenisation -> Dom tree -> CSSOM -> Render Tree -> Render blocking concept -> Script + async/defer + images


Coding question 
Does not discuss the question - should have confirmed the problem statement, or confirmed the sorting of input data
Starts coding before discussion
